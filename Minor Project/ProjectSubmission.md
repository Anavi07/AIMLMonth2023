Summary(Optional) :   The accuracy of my model was 0.41 percent. Here are my final inferences from the data:
**Educational percentages** are highly influential for a candidate to get placed
* **Past work experience** doesn't influence much on your masters final placements
* There are **no gender discrimination** while hiring, but higher packages were given to male
* Academic percentages have **no relation** towards salary package.
